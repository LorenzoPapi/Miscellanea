# Graphic Calculator

It basically converts any video to a sequence of frames on a matplotlib plot.

### Installation
---
First, download the whole directory (you can delete the graph_old.py file, it's not used).
Second, you need [Python](https://www.python.org/): the project has been tested with Python 3.8 but should work with future versions too.
Third, you need to install some libraries:
- [FFMpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), latest version should work fine;
- [Potrace](https://pypi.org/project/pypotrace/), follow the instructions for your OS (I'm sorry for Windows Users)
